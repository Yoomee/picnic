After 5 successful years of PICNIC, we decided that the time was right to start realising a few exciting ideas that we've had for a while now. And we will need your help to make it all happen! So make sure to check out our next newsletters and keep following us on Twitter and Facebook to find out how.</p><p>What you are looking at right now are the first glimpses of a new website and dynamic online network. On 1 June 2011, the first Beta-version will be launched and we can't wait to receive your feedback and input to turn it into a kick-ass online platform in the coming months. Together with you, we will shape the online future of PICNIC.<br/><br/>And not only in our online matters do we welcome your input and ideas. The PICNIC Festival 2011 program will invite you to actively share your thoughts, use your creativity and expertise even more than in preceding years. So make plans now to join us in Amsterdam, 14-16 September, to explore this year's theme of <b>Urban Futures</b>.<br/><br/>The world is undergoing the largest wave of population growth in history: we are looking at more than 8 billion people in 2030 and essentially all of the growth will take place in the less developed countries, concentrated among the poorest populations in urban areas. By that time at least 70% of the world population will be living in an urban environment.<br/><br/>And there is a very good reason for that development: urban environments hold many promises for a better future simply because of their massive scale and density. Cities generate jobs and thus income, they can provide education, healthcare and other services more efficiently than less densely settled areas. And cities offer the chance to climb the social ladder, especially for women.<br/><br/>But the same scale and proximity that provide chances, will also pose many challenges to keep urban life livable. Most cities have never been designed to host a population that soon will surpass that of the entire Netherlands (16,6 million). So can their infrastructure hold up? New York's old electricity grid and sewage system have been showing cracks for some time already. In Paris the public transport infrastructure failed to adapt to the cities growth taking more than 2 hours of travel just to cross the city from one end to the other. <br/><br/>And of course environmental and sustainability issues are a huge challenge in dense areas like (mega)cities: from waste management (the vast landfills in India go hand in hand with the waste crisis in Naples, Italy), to air quality (the smog filled cities in China) and the use of (natural) resources. How can smart technologies help to monitor our usage and visualize the \"problem areas\"?<br/><br/>The huge scale of our (future) megacities will also impact social dynamics and the commitment of residents to keep up the quality of their living environment, ultimately influencing crime rates. In emerging countries like Brazil and India, growing slums demand a new approach of governance and looking at informal economic dynamics. Should the role of governments change? And can the application of open data or the influence of social media play a role in shifting control back to citizens more?<br/><br/>We're looking to engage you and others of the world's most creative and innovative minds at PICNIC Festival 2011. Join us investigating several urban future scenarios, including perspectives on Infrastructure, People, Sustainability, Society and Media.</p>"];
