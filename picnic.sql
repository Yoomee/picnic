We often talk about “building” trust in the things we buy and the systems and spaces we use – can we “program” or “access” trust more effectively in an Internet of Things? \r\n\r\nPremsela’s Trust Design <a href=\"http://www.trustdesign.nl\">www.trustdesign.nl</a> research project was created to explore the relationship between trust and design, focusing on a wide range of design disciplines and applications.

The latest Trust Design/Volume publication details the potential, possibilities, and pitfalls when issues of trust and the Internet of Things meet.

The lateral principles include flexibility, resilience, adaptation and impermanence. The core themes of this lab are:\r\n\r\nCity furniture and infrastructure: How connected can we make the lampposts, traffic lights, traffic signs, garbage cans, roads and sewage systems and what kind of services can we build on top of these? How inclusive can these be? Can plants, animals and resources be seen as equals?\r\nInfrastructure of interaction: The city is an infrastructure of interaction producing “cityness”, an amalgamation of experiences. In a full internet of things many operations will be machine to machine, semi and fully autonomous. How can we learn to live side by side with things we now still perceive as “robots”?\r\n\r\nBusiness models and funding: When we think of infrastructural projects, our minds often connect that with “big”, “scale”, “expensive”, “complex” and “central”. Is it possible to address roads, sewage systems and other infrastructural requirements in a decentralized way while still keeping the balance in costs, productivity and energy efficiency?\r\n\r\nThe format of the workshop is based on “Notes on the Design of Participatory Systems - for the City or the Planet” from Usman Haque of Pachube:\r\n\r\n♥	Step 1: Identify the dilemma in small groups of five participants\r\n♥	Step 2: Identify the stakeholders.\r\n♥	Step 3: List incentives for stakeholders to act or change.\r\n♥	Step 4: What is the evidence that the acts or changes have occurred?\r\n♥	Step 5: This is the most important step: Creating a tool for evidence to help convince the end users that the dilemma is real, the incentives are right, and that the tools for change need to be adopted.\r\n','2011-09-14 08:00:00','2011-09-14 15:15:00','2011-06-30 12:24:11','2011-08-24 15:06:08',1,NULL),(28,'Vodafone Firestarters',6,'Vodafone Firestarters is a traveling talk show that takes place at a series of events within the art, music, technology and fashion industries. \r\n\r\nInnovative people within a worldwide network surround Vodafone.

We wish to spread the use of Users as Designers; to improve our own understanding by sharing and learning from the responses; and to sow the seeds of change we hope will flourish. Users as Designers is the main design philosophy of Waag Society. The basis of this philosophy is the involvement of a select number of users in every stage of a project, from first investigations and design inspiration to pilot testing. By involving prospective users in the design process, the results are more likely to deliver meaningful perspectives and options to actual users. Adoption and appropriation of the results become more likely than with traditional methods of development.\r\n\r\nOpen to all (max. 20)\r\n','2011-09-15 12:00:00','2011-09-15 14:00:00','2011-06-30 14:54:42','2011-08-18 14:00:18',1,NULL),(72,'Lunch break',3,'Lunch','2011-09-15 10:00:00','2011-09-15 11:30:00','2011-06-30 15:01:23','2011-08-18 14:00:18',1,NULL),(73,'Lunch break',3,'Lunch','2011-09-16 10:00:00','2011-09-16 11:30:00','2011-06-30 15:01:36','2011-08-18 14:00:18',1,NULL),(74,'Lunch break',2,'Class aptent taciti sociosqu ad litora torquent per conubia nostra, per inceptos himenaeos.

Something that totally redefines the way we think about the later years in life. There is nothing that \"just happens.\" Like going on vacation - does your trip just come along or did you have to organize it? I am sure you did - and when you did you made choices about the most convenient or exciting means of transportation, a cool destination with lots of new experiences, you probably checked the guide for the best restaurants, and the best local food. Now translate that to the final years of your life. Do not just let it happen – explore it – design it – make the best and the most amazing out of it. This is where the \"elderly\" becomes \"your future self\". This is where we start to redefine the way society looks at ageing, by designing it ourselves!\r\n\r\nThe world is facing a growing ageing society. In addition to the growing number of elderly, their average age is also increasing. This creates new challenges in several areas. How do we face these challenges, especially in a time of economic crisis? Could the stress within the real estate field perhaps serve as a window for opportunities for the age of new building? Could we apply the living lab approach to build for our future self and establish the human ware of architecture? \r\n\r\nLast year’s workshop we focused on living and ageing in the utopian city and together we explored new types of architecture that envision aging as a normal part of life. This year we will address the social glue of architecture. How can we reengineer existing buildings and integrate– next to the hardware and software of architecture – the human ware into the design. The workshop will be interactive, and together we will try to get a grip on the social glue of architecture. \r\n		\r\nThis workshop is a coproduction between media lab Waag Society and the New York City based architecture and concept design firm Hollwich Kushner HWKN. The office deploys targeted research and fast-footed development to create innovative and responsible projects that exist at the intersection of client, user, and nature.\r\n\r\nMatthias Hollwich is the co-founder of HWKN and together with the University of Pennsylvania he also initiated the New Ageing Award 2010 in a search for progressive architectural designs (realized or conceptual) for the elderly, such as\r\nBOOM: Bold New Community. This is an urban village located in a spectacular desert setting in the Palm Springs area. BOOM is the brainchild of ten renowned architects joined together by a vision to build a new icon of design that dares to redefine home, community and how we live and grow together.\r\n\r\nThe speakers and participants in the workshop share the same interest in social innovation, new media and technology. The workshop will investigate different angles to approach a few of the challenges that lay ahead. \r\n\r\nThe workshop can accommodate 25 people max and is especially interesting for professionals working in the field of social innovation, healthcare, architecture and innovation, living labs and user-centred design. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n','2011-09-15 08:00:00','2011-09-15 11:00:00','2011-06-30 15:03:09','2011-08-18 14:00:18',1,NULL),(76,'Reflecting on Hypermud building, urban future is young sessions, VURB workshop',7,'Reflecting on VURB, The Urban future is Young and HYPERMUD \r\n\r\nPresentation of the workshop outcomes and reflections on the visions, ideas, impact and possible newly generated initiatives.\r\nOpen to all\r\n','2011-09-16 08:00:00','2011-09-16 11:30:00','2011-06-30 15:03:22','2011-08-18 14:00:18',1,NULL),(77,'Lunch break',1,'','2011-09-16 10:00:00','2011-09-16 11:30:00','2011-06-30 15:04:08','2011-08-18 14:00:18',1,NULL),(78,'Lunch break',5,'','2011-09-15 10:00:00','2011-09-15 11:30:00','2011-06-30 15:04:52','2011-08-18 14:00:18',1,NULL),(79,'Lunch break',5,'','2011-09-16 10:00:00','2011-09-16 11:30:00','2011-06-30 15:05:04','2011-08-18 14:00:18',1,NULL),(80,'Lunch break',6,'','2011-09-15 10:00:00','2011-09-15 11:30:00','2011-06-30 15:05:32','2011-08-18 14:00:18',1,NULL),(81,'Lunch break',6,'','2011-09-16 10:00:00','2011-09-16 11:30:00','2011-06-30 15:05:42','2011-08-18 14:00:18',1,NULL),(82,'Lunch break',7,'','2011-09-15 11:00:00','2011-09-15 12:00:00','2011-06-30 15:06:16','2011-08-18 14:00:18',1,NULL),(84,'Lunch break',8,'','2011-09-15 10:00:00','2011-09-15 11:30:00','2011-06-30 15:06:46','2011-08-18 14:00:18',1,NULL),(85,'Lunch break',8,'','2011-09-16 10:00:00','2011-09-16 11:30:00','2011-06-30 15:07:00','2011-08-18 14:00:18',1,NULL),(86,'Lunch break',9,'','2011-09-15 10:00:00','2011-09-15 11:30:00','2011-06-30 15:07:58','2011-08-18 14:00:18',1,NULL),(87,'Lunch break',9,'','2011-09-16 10:00:00','2011-09-16 11:30:00','2011-06-30 15:08:08','2011-08-18 14:00:18',1,NULL),(88,'Lunch break',7,'','2011-09-16 11:30:00','2011-09-16 13:00:00','2011-06-30 15:08:44','2011-08-18 14:00:18',1,NULL),(89,'The Urban Future is Personal',7,'Session about the future of urban planning and architecture with short presentations and discussion.

Moreover, it can become a material for various industrial applications. Investigations have determined that mycelia in its natural state can hold up to 30,000 times its mass, and when treated as a material for industrial use, can withstand compression of nearly 200 times it own weight. Its processing production is low-tech and requires fewer resources and less fossil fuel consumption, resulting in a low embodied energy. However, the benefits extend beyond the capabilities of its production and application; it is renewable, biodegradable, highly regenerative, abundant, and it\'s growth is based on the decomposition of matter. The latter is of specific interest since it can break down matter that has a low ability for bio-degradation or is non-biodegradable within the next 1000 years, such as hydrocarbons. Therefore, mycelia can potentially reduce our parts-per-million carbon-offset through its production, creating the first net carbon footprint that is a deficit - ironically suggesting that a solution to a crisis stemming from a finite resource lays in the use of a non-polluting, renewable resource.\r\n\r\nThe question is: Should we intervene in, or interrupt, metabolic cycles and capture the mycelia to use as a material opportunity for architecture? Does this decision depend on the implications of designing mycotecture as a strategy for successfully working within the metabolism of its ecosystem?\r\n\r\n\r\nWorkshop Objectives \r\nThe ONE Lab Biodesign on Mycoform to Mycotecture aims to establish a smart, self-sufficient, perpetual-motion construction technology option.

Cities also produce large amounts of waste, most of which is disposed of locally. How can we spend less money and energy moving resources to cities? Architects, urban planners, and designers will soon have new tools in hand to address this problem. This session will present new biological technologies that will enable cities to locally produce food and materials via recycling. The infrastructure for this new mode of production will look very familiar to residents of Amsterdam: greenhouses and beer brewing. And just like brewing beer, this production will take place at both the large and the small scale. This session will have presentations on using microbes to turn cellulose into replacements for petrochemicals (Blue Marble Biomaterials), using algae to recycle sewage into useful biomass (NASA), and growing a city’s entire food supply in a greenhouse (The Polydome Project). A roundtable discussion with the audience will follow.\r\n\r\nThe 20th century was built on fire and mining. The 21st will be built using biological systems that are much more efficient. With a combination of high-tech jobs and distributed production, biological production will move into cities, enabling those cities to make more of the stuff they use. Locally made materials will supply industry and will allow cities to send less capital overseas to import energy and materials in the form of petroleum. Recycling and production in urban areas will soon look radically different than it does today.\r\n','2011-09-15 08:00:00','2011-09-15 10:00:00','2011-07-22 08:34:14','2011-08-18 14:00:20',1,NULL),(170,'BCreative & ImMediaTe: Launch of How To Grow platform  ',3,'','2011-09-15 08:00:00','2011-09-15 10:00:00','2011-07-22 08:34:26','2011-08-21 15:57:09',1,NULL),(171,'The Data of People, Place and Play',3,'The power of data is in its ability to reveal hidden stories, influence our decisions, and teach us about our environments and communities.

The Energetic Society ',1,'<b>Fix it! The Energetic Society as a New Perspective on Governance for a Clean Economy</b> \r\n\r\nThe ambitious goal of a clean economy and a high-quality society can be achieved. It is the existing powers of creativity and innovation within society that offer opportunities for “green growth”, says Maarten Hajer in the Energetic Society, the PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency Trends Report. Yet in order to exploit the potential of this energetic society, governments need to overhaul their role and position. Not acting comes at a cost: if the government does not adjust, it will be exposed to the powers of the energetic society that may effectively obstruct government initiatives. We need a new partnership and a new division of roles. \r\n\r\nInnovation means scope for action and initiative, accepting the fact that mistakes will be made, and making certain that improvements are identified and implemented rapidly. Such innovation calls for a different type of government based on the notion of “radical incrementalism”. Digitalizing sustainable “achievements” of institutions and businesses can play a key role in this. Fast and continual feedback about behavior and its consequences are of great value to society.\r\n\r\nThe challenge is to do more with less – something for which there is no instant solution. New ideas will constantly be required and may be stimulated by a government that commits itself to clear objectives and makes use of new forms of social engagement.

The design label Crafting Peace was established to create a new approach towards crafts and trade with developing countries. www.craftingpeace.com\n\nRoamler\nRoamler is a mobile workforce that lets businesses, brands and governments get their tasks done by enthusiastic Roamlers.

Producing in the city means less transportation, fresh food and means less use of space through vertical production. So, de groenten uit Amsterdam is the future of farming. www.degroentenuitamsterdam.nl\n\nPhanta Vision\nPhanta Vision is a unique creative company.

Around the world 1 billion people live in informal settlements and their numbers are growing as migration to cities increases. Butterfly Works and youth from Kenya have co-created a mobile app and a board game that deal with the themes of water scarcity, corruption, crime and community development. The aim of the game is to build houses and grow the water source, while maintaining a stable and happy community. By playing the game users become aware of the daily challenges in slums and gain insights into how these problems can be tackled in the real world. The game is currently soft launched in Kenya, is due for full launch in Uganda, and has proven to be unexpectedly popular in Saudi Arabia. The android version is in development and in 2012 we will expand the game with virtual goods that will translate into community projects with slum dwellers in the real world. www.geth20game.com www.butterflyworks.org\n\nCrafting Peace\nCrafting Peace is a design label and philosophy that uses crafts as a means to expand compassion in the world: stitch-by-stitch, bead-by-bead, color-by-color.

On the one hand, crafting is a method of tapping into someone‟s (often undiscovered) potential using hand, head and heart. But on the other hand crafting – however graceful, authentic and artistic it may appear – simply means putting bread on the table in some parts of our world. The design label Crafting Peace was established to create a new approach towards crafts and trade with developing countries. www.craftingpeace.com\n\nRoamler\nRoamler is a mobile workforce that lets businesses, brands and governments get their tasks done by enthusiastic Roamlers.

Main thing missing, I think, is a \'stream\' of all the things clubmembers share. I can in some way find out people are sharing through the leaderboard, but it feels kind of unnatural not being able to see that more specifically. \'Posting a new discussion\' isn\'t really clarifying. Clicking on \'discussion\' (or whatever) and then being directed to the particular thing that is being shared would be nice.\r\n2. I spot a difference between the number 1 and 2 in the leaderboards when switching views between All time and This month. All time Andy has 61 points, This month Franziska has 61 points. Seems not right to me...\r\n3. My avatar, which is not a square, is squeezed into a square when I for example visit this page: http://picnicnetwork.org/members/87/friends\r\n4. At the \'Club\' page there is an intro on the top. It has a button which says Hide this. But after you\'ve done that it says \'Show this\', which looks kind of odd. Should be something like \'Show welcome message\'.\r\n5. I would love to be able to automatically post messages to the Picnic Network through, for example, my Tumbleblog. Would be cool if all the posts I tagged with picnic11 were automatically fetched to this network...\r\n\r\nApart from this I don\'t have a lot of things to add.

Everyone in the Picnic Club is interesting.  However, if I can engage people I can determine which ones would be the most beneficial to meet in such a short period of time. I can also use this platform to learn from some pretty amazing people even if they do not attend or we fail to meet up. \r\n\r\nI was given a link to a book from someone I invited to sit on my blanket that has proven to be a great inspiration.

As the former strategist of Spil Games, Reinout oversaw the foundation from a young games company to one of the most recognized Casual Games Enterprises in the entire industry – in just under three years.\n\nReinout left Spil Games in 2008 to start up his own company. It was 6 months later when MMO Life was born, the first localized MMO games network. Reinout’s story is perhaps not as unique as it is poignant. With his own start-up capital, late night meetings around the kitchen table, and week-end programming, the first portal in wordpress went live in January, 2009. The domain was MMOhub.org (now MMOgames.com). In 12 months an additional 10 MMO portals were in the air covering the regions of Europe, North-America, Brazil, India and China.\n\nBut transformation didn’t take place there. Instead it paved the way for a new strategy, with the establishment of an echo-system off MMO games, bringing traffic and game sign-ups to MMO developers through affiliate partners. MMOTraffic.com was born! http://www.mmotraffic.com\n\nReinout is considered influential in the gaming industry. With a passion for entrepreneurship, strategies and change he’s been frequently featured in the media.\n\nReinout’s work methods falls nothing short of controversial. He often takes a radical approach from vision and idea creation, to architecting strategies and execution. With his “Imitate and Innovate” slogan, he has transformed companies, bringing in new concepts, methods and ideas based on proven business strategies and success formulas.\n\nHis stern, sure-fire and entirely present persona, cuts him an interesting character in the world of games. One thing is for sure; we haven’t seen the last of the man known for his sock-less feet, a slight Eastern Holland accent, with a Partagas-Havana No 2 cigar in the corner of his mouth and an iPhone stuck to his ear.\nSpecialties\n\nMarketing, Finance, Legal, Acquisition, Mergers/joint ventures & Business Development\n','2011-06-29 10:07:28','2011-07-27 14:19:39',NULL,0,1,NULL,'717807174',6469092,16,'lots of fun and games :)','F7ow-g4fBP','reinouttebrake',NULL,'6469092-auvgz0SwnVAmzkK5BCVxtPM23zMCyh6GuyJpVe78','hm2exdeFK54RupUtBe1XXCcNj6yozjXl2o5HzZOP4Q',0,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,1,1,1,NULL,NULL,NULL),(490,'inge.vanderkraan@kenniskring.nl','','minipush32','Inge','van der Kraan',0,'','Assistent at KennisKring Amsterdam (Amsterdam Knowledge Network Foundation)','2011-06-29 10:19:23','2011-06-29 10:19:23','2011/06/29/03_19_23_134_file',0,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,2,'...','dDgKy9H8cG',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,'3506b7ca-22bc-4dc0-855d-1cb0b38b7d82','c06750eb-c0d5-42f9-9a68-9f66875f6abe','http://www.linkedin.com/in/ingevanderkraan',0,0,1,1,1,NULL,NULL,NULL),(491,'eddy@beeblebrox.nl','','xrayblue17','Eddy','Boeve',0,'','Resultant bij de freelancefirm.

I am a writer, creative director and strategist for design and urban initiatives, working with a number of cities, institutions and publications worldwide.\r\n\r\nI created and directed Urban Play for Droog Design and the city of Amsterdam to launch a new generation of objects and areas for the city. Working with Stefan Sagmeister, Marti Guixe, NL Architects and others, a series of objects and areas were created as public catalysts for further design interventions. Recently I created the Bairro Criativo project for Porto, Portugal to bring open idea generation, grass-roots innovation and creative processes to wider audiences in the city and create direct design responses to they city’s needs.\r\n\r\nWhen I’m not working on creative strategies for cities, I go after big ideas and issues facing design and cities. In this realm I am currently directing the Trust Design project for Premsela, the Netherlands Institute for Design in Amsterdam. Trust Design explores the relationship between trust and design in all areas of design, from our products to our shared urban spaces. As part of Trust Design, I am the Editor for a special 4-issue publication series in collaboration with Volume Magazine, and guest lecturer at Design Academy Eindhoven.\r\n\r\nIn addition to contributing to a number of publications, I am the author of “Finding the Truth in Systems: In Praise of Design Hacking”, an exploration of how hacking and open approaches are transforming design and cities everywhere. My speaking credits include addressing the International Conference on European Policy, the World Urban Development Congress, and guest lecturing at Central Saint Martin’s School of Art and Design, London, University of Quebec, Montreal, the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, and many others.\r\n\r\nIn years past I was Creative Director for the UK’s Urbis Centre for Urban Culture from 2003-2006, where I directed numerous large-scale urban projects including Will Alsop’s SuperCity to rethink the future of post-industrial cities, ‘Urban Oasis’ with Berlin’s Office for Subversive Architecture, ‘At Home’ with Peter Saville, and “The China Show”, an overview of contemporary Chinese design and architecture.','2011-08-05 14:40:40','2011-08-20 17:35:47','2011/08/05/07_41_17_252_scott_burnham.jpg',1,0,'68.114.50.128','',NULL,8,'ideas about how to build trust between people and the things and spaces of the city.',NULL,NULL,'Writer, Creative Director & Strategist',NULL,NULL,0,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,0,1,1,1,NULL,NULL,NULL),(830,'ivonne@waag.org','','llPICNIC11','Lawrence ','Lessig',0,'','Lawrence Lessig is the director of the Edmond J.

As creators of the Jejune Institute, an award-winning immersive narrative experience, Nonchalance was successfully able to re-engineer the way  audiences interact with media, the space around them, and each other.  Utilizing automated environments, pirate radio broadcasts, guerilla masonry, and lock boxes within lock boxes, Hull’s work represents a warp zone that transports audiences between hyper realized fantasy worlds.  \n\nPreviously as a street artist with an ambition to infuse more variability and play into the civic realm, Jeff created Oaklandish; a decade-strong community arts organization with 20 consecutive “Best of the East Bay” Awards to it’s credit.  He is also the founder of inner city playground activities such as the Urban Capture the Flag League, the Lake Merritt Radio Regatta, and the Liberation Drive-In which spawned an international movement of rogue parking lot movie screenings.  \n\nJeff began his career in the realm of interactive public arts in 1979, when he was a child performer at Oakland’s Children’s Fairyland, a storybook theme park which was the unsung prototype to Disneyland. Nascent time spent in this wonderland setting inspired much of his life & work since.

In 2008, the same building principles were used to construct the first \"Greenhouse by Joost\", an exhibition and event space at Melbourne’s Federation Square which was open from November 2008 to January 2009 and attracted 1,000 visitors per day, global media attention from major publications and over 2.5 million viewers on YouTube.

By that time at least 70% of the world population will be living in an urban environment.</p>\r\n','<p>\r\n	And there is a very good reason for that development: urban environments hold many promises for a better future simply because of their massive scale and density. Cities generate jobs and thus income, they can provide education, healthcare and other services more efficiently than less densely settled areas. And cities offer the chance to climb the social ladder, especially for women.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	But the same scale and proximity that provide chances, will also amplify challenges to keep urban life livable. Most cities have never been designed to host a population that soon will surpass that of the entire Netherlands (16,6 million). So can their infrastructure hold up, maintaining the distribution of utilties? What about mobility issues, clogged up streets and insufficient transport?</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Environment and sustainability are a huge challenge in dense areas like (mega)cities: from waste management (the vast landfills in India go hand in hand with the waste crisis in Naples, Italy), to air quality (the smog filled cities in China) and the use of (natural) resources. How can technology help to monitor our usage and visualize the &quot;problem areas&quot;?</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	The huge scale of our (future) megacities will also impact social dynamics and the commitment of residents to keep up the quality of their living environment. In emerging countries like Brazil and India, growing slums demand a new approach of governance and valuation of informal economic dynamics. Should the role of governments change? And can the application of open data or the influence of social media play a role in shifting control back to citizens more?</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	We&#39;re looking to engage you and others of the world&#39;s most creative and innovative minds at PICNIC Festival 2011.

In 2010, we introduced the PICNIC Business Program with expanded offerings for start-ups, SMBs and entrepreneurs. One of the participants was Michiel Klonhammer, with his new initiative called MaxClass. Michiel&rsquo;s been hard at work since last year&rsquo;s event, and his social networking platform specifically for schools/classrooms is now live! Keep reading to find out more about Michiel and MaxClass&hellip;</p>\r\n','<h5 class=\"article_intro\">\r\n	Get to know MaxClass: Social media for school and home</h5>\r\n<p>\r\n	We&rsquo;re always curious to find out more about people and companies who participate in PICNIC, especially ones that seem on the brink of having a real impact in their market. Happily, Michiel Klonhammer was more than willing to give us a peek behind the scenes of MaxClass and the process he went through transforming a great idea into a functioning business.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<em>Congratulations on the launch of MaxClass! Can you tell us a little more about your company, who MaxClass is meant for, and the benefits of such a platform?</em></p>\r\n<p>\r\n	MaxClass is a communication platform for pupils, parents and teachers. We call it social media for school and home but it&#39;s different from current social media in that it&#39;s specifically designed for education and it&#39;s private. We first presented the concept during Picnic &lsquo;10 and after a private beta we went live at the end of January 2011. After about 6 weeks we have 250 classes in the Netherlands and - really exciting - since we opened up to non-Dutch schools yesterday we have schools in India, Alaska, Florida, Columbia and Australia. They are all just starting up so it&#39;s too early to know how it&#39;s going but we&#39;re really excited!</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<em>When did you first get the idea for MaxClass? Many great business ideas get stuck at the idea phase. What gave you the courage to actually pursue turning this idea into a business/service?</em></p>\r\n<p>\r\n	I know it sounds crazy, but I simply woke up with the whole idea as a blueprint. I&#39;m happy I told my girlfriend about it in detail that morning otherwise I might not have believed this myself. Somehow I am just completely convinced this needs to be done. Once I started telling people about it, they kept saying that &quot;it must already exist&quot;. But I knew that wasn&#39;t the case so I realized I was on to something important.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<em>How much time was there between the idea stage and the launch stage? Can you walk us through some of your key milestones along the way?</em></p>\r\n<p>\r\n	I started talking about it in 2009 with lots of people (especially parents, teachers and educational publishers) and it took nearly a year of research, sketching and planning before I stopped my job and invested all my money into it.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	I realized I needed a brilliant team to pull this off and I was lucky to find Marc Worrell (ex Mediamatic), Joost Faber (ex Lostboys) and Atilla Erdodi (ex Erlang Solutions) willing to join me.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	That&#39;s really the biggest step - the people. In November we had a big party to launch a private beta and then we were ready to go live at the end of January. So I guess from the morning I woke up, to the day we went live took about 20 months.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<em>Do you consider yourself an &ldquo;entrepreneur at heart&rdquo;? Have you started other businesses in the past, or is this your first venture? What do you find most appealing about running your own business?</em></p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Yes, I think this is my perfect fit. I love art, science and even large corporations but I&#39;m probably at my best in a startup situation. It&#39;s incredible what you can achieve with a small team of smart people. The combination of low overhead and enough energy to work obsessively is pretty productive! But at the same time, I like managing a bigger company as I did before (with ICATT interactive media) so I&#39;m looking forward to growing. It&#39;s fun to work like crazy for a while, but at the same time I want people that work with me to be able to have a life.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<em>You participated in PICNIC &rsquo;10 at Pitch Night and the Chamber of Commerce Marketplace. How did you find out about these activities and what made you decide to attend?</em></p>\r\n<p>\r\n	PICNIC is the coolest event in the Netherlands by far. I love the crazy mix of stuff that goes on.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	I&#39;ve been a visitor several times even though it&#39;s pretty expensive for smaller companies. So I had already decided to try and do our first presentation there somehow. I heard about the specific event through Syntens and the PICNIC mailing lists, so it didn&#39;t take long to jump at that chance.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<em>What did you find most valuable about your experience at PICNIC? Did you gain any good connections or learn something new? If so, please elaborate!</em></p>\r\n<p>\r\n	The nice thing about PICNIC is that a lot of people have an open mind and are just curious. So when you&#39;re still in the phase of getting your story straight, it&#39;s a great place. It&#39;s different from a regular conference because you can discuss instead of only presenting.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	We actually met some of the people that joined the private beta later and we interviewed a lot of visitors to see what they thought. We had three interns that we dressed up as a Russian Camera crew (one of the interns was Russian) - which actually got them past security!</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	I met an investor on the dance floor (this is really true!) who I&#39;m still in contact with.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<em>What are your goals for MaxClass in the coming year?</em></p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Well we&#39;re trying to grow into a platform that is used by a few hundred thousand people. So we have to focus on getting it perfect, letting people know what we&#39;re doing and - not unimportantly - attracting more investors.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<em>What advice would you give to other entrepreneurs who are considering diving in to a new business venture? For example, what are some positive (or even negative) lessons you learned as you were building MaxClass?</em></p>\r\n<p>\r\n	If you are based in the Netherlands, you need to decide you do not care too much if you fail.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	The Dutch are pretty careful people and that gets in the way sometimes. At the same time, you need to know what you&#39;re doing. I chose to work on the idea for a couple of months before writing a business plan. I really don&#39;t believe that you can write a plan at the very start like starting entrepreneurs are often told. Just get to work!</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Something that has been absolutely amazing is that it&#39;s possible to set up a business based on cloud applications - so for the first time ever you can avoid buying expensive licenses for such things as accounting, CRM, domain management, file servers etc and just pay for the use of it all. It&#39;s not free but so much less work and overhead. It&#39;s interesting to experience this as MaxClass is a cloud application as well.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Having said that, I personally need to work with people in one office so I can work side by side with them. I think it&#39;s wise to keep in extremely close contact with the people you work with. Of course you can do it online but I need and enjoy the contact in the office.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<em>Finally, how can people find out more about MaxClass?</em></p>\r\n<p>\r\n	www.maxclass.com</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	michiel(at)maxclass.com</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	www.twitter.com/maxclassEng</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	tel: +31 (0)20 8202383</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Thanks once again to Michiel for sharing his story!

They are putting a name on an era we have already entered, with new attitudes and ideas than the previous generations.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	The elements of Sustainism they identified certainly rang true. Our new cultural perspective can be seen in the current emergence of an interconnected global age, a returned interest in localism, the era of climate change, and the tendency toward openness and sharing.</p>\r\n<h3>\r\n	Naming a cultural shift</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n	With their academic (Michiel) and creative design (Joost) backgrounds, they are clear to state that their strength lies in observation. They are simply putting a name on the current transition in the world we already inhabit, not trying to start a new movement.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Rather than being a dry studious read, &lsquo;Sustainism&rsquo; is a very accessible book, combining a collection of powerful statements with strong symbolism.

This led them to come up with a mobile application that allowed people to &ldquo;check in&rdquo; to physical locations they visited, leave tips and info for other visitors, and compete with each other for &ldquo;digital candy&rdquo; like badges or mayor of a specific location. It also gave companies a new platform for interacting and offering promotions to both new visitors and loyal customers.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Beyond the features of foursquare&rsquo;s mobile apps, Dennis digs deeper to explore how game mechanics &ndash; used in foursquare and elsewhere &ndash; can be used to affect changes in real world behavior and make people think differently about how they experience their physical surroundings.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	http://vimeo.com/17756354</p>\r\n','2011-05-17 17:00:57','2011-08-18 14:00:03','2034-12-31 23:00:00','2010-12-13 17:00:00',1,NULL,0,'',0),(72,15,'Instrumenting the City: Data is King with Andreas Weigend','<p>\r\n	Andreas Weigend loves people and the data they create.

The area, on the outskirts of a slum known as Agbogbloshie, is referred to by local inhabitants as Sodom and Gomorrah, a vivid acknowledgment of the profound inhumanity of the place. When Hugo asked the inhabitants what they called the pit where the burning takes place, they repeatedly responded: &lsquo;For this place, we have no name&rsquo;.</h5>\r\n<p>\r\n	Their response is a reminder of the alien circumstances that are imposed on marginal communities of the world by the West&rsquo;s obsession with consumption and obsolesce. This wasteland, where people and cattle live on mountains of motherboards, monitors and discarded hard drives, is far removed from the benefits accorded by the unrelenting advances of technology.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	The UN Environment Program has stated that Western countries produce around 50 million tons of digital waste every year. In Europe, only 25 percent of this type of waste is collected and effectively recycled. Much of the rest is piled in containers and shipped to developing countries, supposedly to reduce the digital divide, to create jobs and help people. In reality, the inhabitants of dumps like Agbogbloshie survive largely by burning the electronic devices to extract copper and other metals out of the plastic used in their manufacture. The electronic waste contaminates rivers and lagoons with consequences that are easily imaginable. In 2008 Green Peace took samples of the burnt soil in Agbogbloshie and found high concentrations of lead, mercury, thallium, hydrogen cyanide and PVC.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Notions of time and progress are collapsed in these photographs. There are elements in the images that fast-forward us to an apocalyptic end of the world as we know it, yet the alchemy on this site and the strolling cows recall a pastoral existence that rewinds our minds to a medieval setting. The cycles of history and the lifespan of our technology are both clearly apparent in this cemetery of artifacts from the industrialized world. We are also reminded of the fragility of the information and stories that were stored in the computers which are now just black smoke and melted plastic.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Source: Pieter Hugo <a href=\"http://www.pieterhugo.com/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.pieterhugo.com</a></p>\r\n','2011-08-25 11:38:52','2011-08-25 12:33:51','2035-01-01 00:00:00','2011-08-25 11:37:00',1,NULL,0,'',1),(205,53,'Alone in New York',NULL,'<h5 class=\"article_intro\">\r\n	The Big Apple seen in from an emotional point of view.</h5>\r\n<p>\r\n	Source: Guiseppe Vetrano <a href=\"http://www.giuseppevetrano.it/ \" target=\"_blank\">http://www.giuseppevetrano.it</a></p>\r\n','2011-08-25 12:02:29','2011-08-25 12:04:31','2035-01-01 00:00:00','2011-08-25 12:00:00',1,NULL,0,'',1),(206,53,'The Future of Hope','','<h5 class=\"article_intro\">\r\n	Over the past 20 years we have seen a growing realization that the current model for society and culture is unsustainable.

Since it is for only three days, and we only have about a week to build it. To create a city-link atmosphere we started the PICNIC Poster Project. We’re inviting hand-picked leading designers and agencies in our international networks, to make artwork for us in the form of ‘posters’ (both vertical and horizontal for screen based applications). Posters we can use in several ways, from decoration on site (poster walls like in real cities, but then all related to PICNIC Festival), online as backgrounds for the website or announcing separate themes, workshops or speakers, for media and even the visual speaker announcements during the festival. This leads to a highly diverse and eclectic visual language that brings the city to life. We have started from the overarching theme ‘Urban Futures’, then narrow down to the main categories to people (speakers, presenters, etc.).\n\nAt this moment a variety of creatives is working on their contributions and we can’t wait to see the first results.

Vraagt u zich wel eens af waarom die niet perfect is verlopen? Ik wel! Met perfect bedoel ik dan dat een perfect ronde oerklont met een precisie die, zoals wij nu weten alleen in de mathematica voorkomt, vanaf tijdstip nul tot oneindig, perfect puntsymetrisch (allerlei opgerolde dimensies en parallelle universums daargelaten) uitelkaar is geploft. We kunnen allemaal zien dat dat niet het geval is en daaruit concluderen dat het ontstaan van ons universum vanaf het allereerste moment al in de oersoep is gelopen. Althans voor diegenen die in iedere afwijking van perfectie – wat dat ook moge zijn – een fout zien. \n\nZijn we een mislukt experiment van een of andere Deïteit of een schitterend ongeluk, zoals de na zijn interview met John Coetzee nooit meer helemaal herstelde Wim Kaiser opperde? Ik weet het niet, maar ik vraag me wel af wat de oerfluctuatie heeft veroorzaakt waardoor de hele santenkraam over elkaar heen is gedonderd en uiteindelijk, toen de stofwolken op waren getrokken, in staat bleek zichzelf te organiseren tot hetgeen we nu om ons heen zien. Misschien heeft Zijne omnipotentie (er waren toen nog geen vrouwen, dat weet ik zeker) bewust zijn equivalent van een vinger in de perfecte schepping gestoken, als een spaak in het voorste wiel van het op de finish aanstormende peloton. Gewoon, effe kijken wat er gebeurt. \n\nZo bekeken is de Goddelijke vonk, de Heilige kink in de kabel van de oersaaie perfectie, het ontstaan van diversiteit door de imperfectie van de oerknal. Dus kom niet aan met dat het allemaal intelligent design is. Niemand had zoiets als – ik noem maar wat – Glitter Glamour Gordon en de toppers kunnen bedenken. Hoe ‘intelligent’ zou dat zijn? Nee, het zijn juist de paradijsvogels die evolutie bevestigen. In ons universum is perfectie de anomalie en evolutie het basale organisatorisch paradigma, met diversiteit (of het ontbreken van perfectie) als condicio sine qua non. Misschien zult u zeggen, “Tuurlijk, diversiteit is belangrijk. Wij hebben er speciaal iemand voor aangenomen. Die managet het allemaal keurig, want ik zie steeds meer allochtonen en vrouwen bij ons rondlopen.” Dan zal het u verbazen dat dat niet is wat ik bedoel. \n\nLaat ik het, voordat mijn uiteraard zeer gerespecteerde doch toch al vrij selecte lezersgroepje zich geheel van mij afkeert, met een voorbeeld proberen toe te lichten. In de Wetenschap bijlage van het VK van 11 juni 2011 stond een artikel waaruit blijkt dat ik geen open deur sta in te trappen. In dat paginagrote artikel wordt ons namelijk als een revelatie openbaard dat steeds meer biologen denken dat dieren een eigen karakter hebben en dat dat niet slechts een menselijke projectie is. Wie had dat zonder bewijs willen geloven? \n\nIk citeer: “[...] Wetenschappers hielden zich altijd verre van deze ‘vermenselijking’. Ten onrechte, zo blijkt de laatste jaren. Dierpersoonlijkheden lijken de regel en niet de uitzondering. [...] Het best onderzocht is de koolmees: ‘Wij vinden hier een breed scala aan gedragingen,’ zegt Kees van Oers, die promoveerde op koolmeespersoonlijkheden [...] In zijn huidige onderzoek probeert hij variatie te verklaren. Hij zoekt daarvoor bij grote aantallen koolmezen naar verbanden tussen genvariaties en specifieke karakters. [...] ‘Gedragsbiologen bekeken een soort doorsnee dier,’ zegt de theoretisch bioloog Weissing. ‘Ze bestudeerden dus het gemiddelde gedrag, maar in werkelijkheid kan dat individueel sterk afwijken.’ Van Oers beaamt dit: ‘Vroeger zag men variatie in gedrag tussen individuen als ruis. Er is een optimale manier om iets te doen, dus iedereen die afwijkt is fout.’ [...]” \n\nZo gaat het nog een tijdje door, volgens een wiskundig model zou het gedrag van dieren bepaald worden door wat ze te ‘verliezen’ hebben. Bijvoorbeeld als ze “in de toekomst nog veel nageslacht verwachten, gedragen ze zich voorzichtiger dan individuen zonder vooruitzichten.” Dat van die individuen zonder vooruitzichten herken ik wel, maar zouden dieren aan gezinsplanning doen? De vraag waar men mee blijkt te zitten is welke voorwaarden nodig zijn om de verschillende persoonlijkheden te laten ontstaan, de variatie laten we maar zeggen. Bij onderzoek naar stekelbaarzen heeft ene Dingemanse aanwijzingen gevonden dat “omgevingsfactoren [...] essentieel zijn.” \n\nWat ik me afvraag is: als Weissing stelt dat hij nooit heeft getwijfeld dat dierpersoonlijkheden bestaan – ‘Ik kom van een kleine boerderij, daar ken je alle dieren van dichtbij.’ – wat is dan de waarde van wetenschap? Of beter, wat is de waarde van wetenschappelijke methoden, als de realiteit zoals iedereen die kan waarnemen wordt vervangen door een model waarin geen plaats is voor het universele ordeningsprincipe: evolutie? Zonder welke er niets zou zijn dan perfect uitdijende materie/ruimte, laat staan homo rationale en zijn wetenschappelijke methode? Zo gezien lijkt wetenschap steeds meer op een zoektocht naar het grote ‘intelligent’ design van een almachtig opperwezen. ',0,'2011-06-29 11:23:16','2011-06-29 11:23:16','',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(94,496,88,'Photo','De vork in de weg\r\n\r\nLaatst sprak ik op een cursus homeopathisch aquarelleren een apotheker. U begrijpt, hij was daar niet voor zijn plezier, het was netwerken. Zelf niet prakkiserend bleek hij als manager van een keten zijn collega apothekers te inspireren. We raakten in gesprek over de toestand in de wereld en al gauw vernauwde zich dat tot zijn wereld. Nou geloof ik in de holografie van … nou ja van alles eigenlijk, dus ik slikte (&lt;–woordgrap) het.\r\n\r\nNadat hij mij haarfijn had uitgelegd wat voor een onrecht er in de farmacie was aangericht vroeg hij wat ik precies deed. Ik heb nogal een hekel aan die vraag en vooral het woordje ‘precies’ er in, maar ook deze inhaleerde ik. Ik vertelde dat ik wat deed met sociale media en internet en journalistiek en dat ik zelf een smartphone appje aan het ontwikkelen was voor mensen die medicijnen gebruiken. Hij trok zijn wenkbrauwen op en zei: “Dat is ook toevallig, ik ben me net aan het oriënteren op een visie op het inzetten van sociale media voor onze business. Weet je daar wat van?” “Ik weet wat van farmacie en van sociale media, dus ja”, antwoordde ik. “Vertel, hoe pak je dat aan?” “Nou,” zeg ik, “daar vraag je nogal wat. Er is in ieder geval geen Haarlemmerolie voor.” Hij negeerde de briljante woordgrap, keek me zwijgend, ietwat meewarig aan en ik besloot me te laten gebruiken als een wegwerpspuit.\r\n\r\nDe ontwikkeling van de technologie heeft een punt bereikt waarop alles anders kan. Vanaf de introductie van de computer is het ingezet om de bestaande processen te automatiseren. Dat begon bij volkstellingen en nu is het zover dat voor vrijwel ieder proces in een organisatie de computer leidend is. Neem de apotheek, daar is alles geautomatiseerd van binnenkomst tot uitgifte en controle. Gek genoeg is er in het proces van de apotheek in 150 jaar vrijwel niets veranderd. De computer heeft van veel organisaties één groot computerprogramma gemaakt dat hier en daar bij de invoering wordt ondersteund door mensen. Dat zie je overal en nog steeds zijn hele volksstammen bezig met procesoptimalisatie en re-engeneering te verkopen als innovatie, terwijl de meeste verzekeraars en banken, automatiseerders van het eerste uur, gegijzeld worden door het spaghetti monster dat ze zelf ontwikkeld hebben.\r\n\r\nWat ze niet beseffen is dat de technologie zo ver is dat er een geheel nieuwe realiteit is ontstaan waarin alles anders kan. Als je dat wilt gaan zien, moet je niet out-of-the-box denken, maar out-of-the-box stappen. De kracht ervan kun je niet zien die moet je ervaren, je zult je er in onder moeten dompelen en van daaruit kijken wat er kan. Want één ding is zeker, als het kan, gaat iemand het doen.\r\n\r\n“Nou volgens mij maak je het wat te ingewikkeld.” “Hoezo ingewikkeld, het is niet ingewikkeld, het is anders.” “Hoe zit het dan met appie [het boodschappen appje van Albert Heijn], dat is een enorm succes.” “Mmm, een apotheek is toch geen supermarkt?” “Nee, maar wij moeten gewoon ook zo’n ‘killer-app’ bedenken”. “Grappig dat je het een killer-app noemt, want misschien wordt het wel het einde van Albert Heijn.” “Hoezo?” “Nou als iedereen dat appje gaat gebruiken hoef je toch niet meer naar de supermarkt? Waarom zou er dan nog een winkel zijn? Misschien komt er dan wel een partij die zegt, weet je wat, ik ga er anders tussen zitten. Ik bied spullen aan uit de streek, die ik rechtstreeks inkoop bij de boer, veel goedkoper. De rest koop ik gewoon rechtstreeks bij Unilever of Pijnenburg (of is dat ook van Unilever?). Ik open geen winkels, alleen magazijnen, breng alles thuis of waar je maar wilt. Ik houd in de gaten of de melk op is of de koffie en informeer mijn klanten. Ik organiseer excursies naar boeren om te laten zien hoe producten gemaakt worden. Nodig Klootwijk uit om te vertellen over de beste manier om vis te roken. Wie niet kan bekijkt het filmpje thuis op zijn internet televisie. Ik organiseer kook-ins, vertel over wat eten doet voor je energieniveau, je slaap of voor je seksleven. Ik vraag mensen te vertellen wat een glutenvrijdieet voor ze doet en laat ze doorklikken naar het glutenvrij assortiment, inclusief recepten en filmpjes van beroemde koks. Enzovoort, enzovoort.”\r\n\r\n“Maar dat kan Albert Heijn toch zelf ook doen?”\r\n“Inderdaad.

Vooral het woord ‘toeloop’ roept een beeld op van hordes doorgedraaide mensen die als zombies in een Michael Jackson clip op de gebouwen van de GGZ af strompelen. Alles bij elkaar wordt er op zo’n 40 fronten geschrapt in de zorg, waaronder een bijna gehele afschaffing van het PGB. Het zijn de nieuwste diagnose-behandel combinaties van het kabinet om het land economisch te helen, in het publiek belang natuurlijk. \r\n\r\nDe staatsecretaris van volksgezondheid wil mensen ‘minder afhankelijk maken’, want mensen lijden aan de Barthel-paradox. Die stelt dat mensen steeds afhankelijker worden naarmate je ze meer uit handen neemt. Al die hulp maakt mensen afhankelijk, dan gaan ze achterover leunen en laten de hoorn des overvloeds vloeien. Zelfredzaamheid daar is dit kabinet van, mensen die zo min mogelijk hulp van anderen nodig hebben en dus ook van de overheid. \r\n\r\nAls je ernstig ziek wordt/bent of een gehandicapt kind krijgt valt je zelfredzaamheid onherroepelijk terug. Je wordt nog meer afhankelijk van technologie dan we nu al zijn, maar ook van mensen, financiering en omstandigheden. Dan mag je hopen dat er mensen in je omgeving zijn die je bijstaan op een manier die bij je past, mensen die je toestand kennen zonder dat jij - of als het ernstiger is iemand in je omgeving - die telkens moet uitleggen. En dan heb je het alleen nog maar over overleven, dat staat nog los van zingeving, dat je er toe doet, er bij hoort, voor jezelf, je familie, je vrienden, de maatschappij, dat je naar vermogen een bijdrage levert, in wat voor een vorm dan ook. En om die onafhankelijkheid te bevorderen heeft de staatssecretaris volgend jaar 1,35 miljard begroot om zorgaanbieders te stimuleren het aanbod te realiseren dat de burger wenst (dat is wat het pgb al die tijd al doet) en 0,0009 miljard om de positie van de burger in het zorgstelsel te versterken. \r\n\r\nAfschaffing van het pgb wordt nog moeilijker te begrijpen als je beseft wat het alternatief is: zorg in natura. Dat klinkt sympathiek, maar het komt er op neer dat anderen dan de patiënt of diens verzorgers (lees verzekeraars) gaan bepalen waar, wanneer, welke zorg door wie geleverd wordt. Wat de staatsecretaris in feite zegt is dat de zelfredzaamheid die het pgb biedt leidt tot verslaving aan hulp en afhankelijkheid bevordert en dat je de zorg beter aan door de overheid goedgekeurde professionals over kunt laten, liefst in een zorginstelling. Dat is pas een paradox. Kwalitatief hoge, contextgedreven zorg wordt overgeheveld naar systemische en per definitie duurdere productgedreven zorg. Kennelijk is controle toch belangrijk dan zelfredzaamheid. \r\n\r\nDe overheid lijkt steeds meer op een bediener van geldkranen. Die wat meer open, die wat meer dicht en daar een stop in. Daarbij wordt strak gekeken naar hoeveel er wegstroomt, hoeveel er effectief aankomt lijkt het probleem van anderen te zijn. In het geval van de geestelijke gezondheidszorg blijkt bij de jaarlijkse opname van de meterstand dat er twee keer zoveel is ‘weggestroomd’ dan vorig jaar, dus moet de kraan flink dichtgedraaid worden. Hoe het komt dat er steeds meer mensen psychische hulp nodig hebben, daar hoor je geen Kamerlid - en trouwens ook geen journalist - over. \r\n\r\nIk vrees dat we het paradoxale beleid van deze regering voorlopig moeten accepteren. Dat betekent dat we het zelf gaan regelen en gelukkig hebben we de tijd en de technologie mee. Wie nu op internet rondkijkt ziet dat het pgb de zelfredzaamheid heeft gestimuleerd. Het streven daarnaar is niet meer te stoppen, ook niet als je het pgb om zeep brengt, laat verdorren wat er is ontstaan en iedereen wegzet als afhankelijke steun verslaafden, inclusief al die mensen die keihard werken om naar vermogen bij te dragen aan de samenleving. Dit Paradox Gedreven Beleid zal mensen aan de voet van de samenleving mondiger maken en de overheid naar het punt drijven waar haar legitimatie om macht over burgers uit te oefenen verdampt. Vanuit dat gezichtspunt kan ik me voorstellen dat er nogal wat mensen voor zulk soort maatregelen zijn. Weer zo’n paradox.

I have been working on a future visioning and social impact model using silent films and documentaries to drive policy change of cities  and learning and to include wellbeing, culture and a more humanized dimension to urban policies, connecting communities worldwide . The augmented reality could add a fascinating element. \n\nMy journey started with a real project with street kids in Delhi in 2009 and working hard to move to the next stage of funding and development. I am starting to have  my voice heard at European culture policy level. Next step is Slovenia in November.\n\nCheck out Delhi City Symphony or Global City Symphony. \n\nBIG BANG NIGHT - CROWDVERSATIONS ON SCREEN  I organized a screening last week in London and also have created a network online for people interested in the convergence between culture, creativity, innovation and technology for social change.

I came across this recently - created by the SENSEable City Lab at MIT.  best viewed in full screen it gives a glimpse of the future made manifest today.\n\nThe real-time city is now real! The digital revolution has layered a vast system of cameras, communication devices, microcontrollers and sensors over our environment, enabling entirely new ways to imagine, monitor, and understand our cities. These systems have a value that goes beyond their original purpose: the digital exhaust of cellular networks reveals social and economic patterns, tracking systems highlight global material flows, and digitally managed transportation fleets address a city\'s mobility. Taken together, the impact of digital networks on cities will be as significant as any past human undertaking.\n\nLIVE Singapore!, an ongoing initiative by the SENSEable City Lab at MIT, closes the feedback loop between people moving in the city and the digital data generated by their actions. The project\'s platform allows for the collection and combination of multiple data streams and provides access to data through dynamic visualizations that offer new insights into Singapore\'s urban dynamics.\n\nLIVE Singapore! provides people with access to a range of useful real-time information about their city by developing an open platform for the collection, elaboration and distribution of real-time data that reflect urban activity. Giving people visual and tangible access to real-time information about their city enables them to take their decisions more in sync with their environment, with what is actually happening around them.',1,'2011-08-17 04:16:13','2011-08-17 04:16:13','',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(287,510,72,'Link','Hello everyone, \n\nI just wanted to let you know that the September 2011 issue of Scientific American is devoted to Better / smarter cities.

Through a series of events this project will investigate pre-conceived ideas of self-organisation and the role of gender politics within this. The project will examine models of organisation especially from the position of an artist-run space and how this fits within a neo-liberal framework and is potentially complicit in the growing precarity of all labour. The project title references the fourth issue of the publication \'Class War\', which controversially introduced Autonomist ideas to the London anarchist scene in the mid 1980s.\n\nEvents will feature a wide variety of artists, activists, writers, designers and academics who are part of a growing network engaged in self-organisation and self-publishing. Speakers include Franco ‘Bifo’ Berardi, Nina Wakeford, Mark Fisher, the Free Association and the Alliance of Radical Bookshops plus more to be confirmed.\n\nWorkshops and panel discussions will be held throughout the event by Auto Italia, Book Bloc and the Deterritorial Support Group, along with daily podcasts recorded and distributed online. A new publication will be produced outlining the live programme along with interviews and discussions from international organisations with an additional supplement made during the course of the project in the exhibition space by Michael Oswell.\n\n\'We have our own idea of Time and Motion\' comes from a network of artists who have formed around Auto Italia and its programme and is a product of artists finding affinity with each others’ projects, ideas and aspirations. It draws on the intangible expertise, knowledge and network which Auto Italia is a part of and will produce new information that can develop a wider narrative for the future of grass-roots projects and artist-led organisation.\n\nA timetable will be released shortly with a detailed schedule and full list of participants.',1,'2011-08-17 05:20:20','2011-08-17 05:20:20','',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(290,693,304,'Photo','Cities of the future will regard Internet connectivity rather like water.

Though you see a lot of water when we create our messages, the fact is that we use 1/30th the amount of water it takes to create a piece of paper of comparable size. The images for Planet of the Apes required about 20 to 25 litres each. Water IS precious which is why we have established a water foundation that allows us to contribute towards providing clean drinking water where water is scarce. - GreenAdsBlue-. We donate 5 euro cents for every liter we use.\nWe are by no means the perfect solution! We have an impact on the environment, we do use fossil fuels to power our equipment. But we believe we are a better alternative to traditional out of home advertising posters and billboards; We do not use paper - paper which is often not from controlled sources (billboards are printed on PVC even worse), we do not use inks - inks that are either petroleum based (printed double sided to work with back-lighting) in the case of paper posters or aggressive solvent based inks in the case of billboards.  Our ads are not back lit or front lit including the 5 or 6 hours a night very people are even outside to see them and we generate very little waste. Posters are generally up for one week and Billboards two to four after which time they are thrown away. (hopefully recycled). \nWe also donate a lot of work to local communities and do cleaning projects in playgrounds for instance as part of trying to be a socially responsible company. And I think this is what is the future. It is not our techniques that are innovative - reverse graffiti has been around for many decades - it is our approach to business. Using GreenGraffiti® the business as a tool for social and environmental improvement. Working with the idea of earning profits of course as we are a business and need to pay the rent but earning profits with principles.\nPeople like yourself are very important to our company. Our water awareness and thus water foundation are the direct result of comments we got about our water consumption and you know, they were right! Water is precious. We can\'t eliminate it from our processes but we can take steps to reduce our water usage, to use gray water sources (health issues here) and to perhaps use it here but provide it there. \nWe learn a lot from people outside our company and would welcome your thoughts as to what we are doing wrong and where we could do better. You have some concerns about what we are doing and we would hope you would share them with us and perhaps provide some solutions that would help people with the same issues you have, understand or even tolerate better what we are doing on the streets. Please, feel free to critique us, we need to know where we can do better and what things are rubbing people the wrong way.\n\nThanks for raising the question!\nJIm','2011-08-12 06:35:31','2011-08-12 06:35:31',NULL,NULL,1),(178,247,257,'Hi Jim,\n\n\nYour contribution to the future urban cities (in 2030) goal is to replace all bilboards/current advertisement  on the streets with water spray art to make 2030 a better world?!?\n\ncheck this out  www.aurasma.com   this is the future for advertising on the streets\n\n ','2011-08-12 07:22:18','2011-08-12 07:22:18',NULL,NULL,1),(179,108,260,'It so should ... but not at the expense of reality !','2011-08-12 08:37:04','2011-08-12 08:37:04',NULL,NULL,1),(180,863,255,'thanks to the PICNIC team and the great people being on stage and attending it\'s highly addictive to come again and again','2011-08-12 10:00:48','2011-08-12 10:00:48',NULL,NULL,1),(181,139,257,'Michiel!\nLove to really talk.

GG has always been open to collaboration, to people adding their ideas and criticism. We know the best new ideas will come from people outside the company. GreenADsBlue our water foundation is one such idea that came about by looking at concerns of the general public most who viewed our water use as wasting a natural resource even though we actually use 1/30 the amount of water it takes to create a piece of paper ot the same size.\nAnother thing to consider is that (unfortunately as I am a big believer in sustainable development/duurzaamheid) few of our clients has used GreenGraffiti® because of it\'s sustainable benefits. This is seen mostly as a \"bonus\" - a feel good factor but not a position that drives sales. Even companies such as Triodos, Essent, Unilever, even Amsterdam Duurzaam dag and a long list of companies claiming to be sustainably focuses who we have met with prefer to use Abris and Billboards as it is just \"easier\", \"safer\" and \"known\". They like the concept, support us as a young ambitious company with an innovative approach but end of day they are still business as usual businesses often using sustainability as a marketing tool rather than practicing what they preach. Emotion though heart warming and the reason for the shear volume of world wide media attention we have received, does not sell services. We have learned we have to focus on the business benefits to sell our services not our sustainable proposition which is quite frankly a pretty sad insight into how businesses are really approaching their sustainable ambitions in the Netherlands.\n\nDo you develop AR Apps?
